// npm install express
// npm i nodemon -g  (for auto restart the server when we make changes in the code)
// refer server.js file for the code of basic express application

// ===========================================================

// 4. Middleware
// Done before the route handler and it is used to modify the request and response objects and it can also be used to perform some operations before the route handler is executed. for example, we can use middleware to check if the user is authenticated before allowing them to access a certain route. we can also use middleware to log the request and response objects for debugging purposes.
